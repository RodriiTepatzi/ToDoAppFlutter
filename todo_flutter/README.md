# ToDoAppFlutter

This simple task application made in flutter, contains no connection to any external database just a local database.

## About

Feel free to fork and modify this project, if you have found any issue and want to commit, do it, I will check it as soon as I can. 

If you also want to add a new function on this application you can do it through forking this project.

I will be developing and mantaining this app on my free time but the source code will be always available.

This application was made using provider, if you want to change it to bloc patter you can do it by yourself. How ever since this may not be a huge app I recommend keep it on provider. I will try to keep everything separate if you also want to practice both patterns with this application.

Like I said before, I will keep working on this application to improve it if needed. But at this point, I am only practicing with this.
